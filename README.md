## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 5 project in the Treehouse Techdegree curriculum. This project uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an employee directory.

The project requests a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

## Known Bugs
